# iPBSA is a script for docking results rescoring
!!! This is a beta version for reviewers, after manuscript revision, the major version will be realized. !!!


To use this script you need to have a receptor and ligands in their docked conformations in the PDB format with the following names and folders:

$DIR/iPDBS.sh    
$DIR/mols/all_ligantd*.pdb - a folder named "mols" with ligands in PDB format   
$DIR/rec.pdb  - receptor named "rec.pdb"  

Once the files are prepared as it is described above, you need just activate and run the script.
